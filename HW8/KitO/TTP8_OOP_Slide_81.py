##### Python Object-Oriented Programming (slide 81)
"""
Create an employee class. 
Each employee has characteristics such as name and salary. 
The class should have a counter that calculates the total number of employees, 
as well as a method that prints the total number of employees 
and a method that displays information about each employee in particular, namely the name and salary.

In addition to creating a class, display information about the base classes 
from which the employee class is inherited (__base__), the class namespace (__dict__), 
the class name (__name__), the module name in which the class is defined (__module__), 
the documentation bar ( __doc__)
